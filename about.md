# About/Read Me
## Introduction
Upon reading [Read Me Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html), I have decided to write the intent of this mind repository.

This blog is intended for me to organize mental pursuits, which often emerge as  temporary offshoots but never quite flower. I hope that by committing (pun intended) these ideas here, they can have the potential to solidify into something helpful to someone, somewhere.

## Needs Assessment
Instead of completing a programming course for the sake of completing one, I have decided to direct my learning in a self-directed, project-based approach. This is to satisfy my need to create something useful or to fulfill a long-dreamt about idea, while at the same time logging my progress towards development of a set of skill sets.

I am motivated to keep my abilities up to date—I often ask myself; can I be soon replaced by a script? Unfortunately, I believe that a large part of my job can soon be. Furthermore, is the field that I’m in moving towards a need for the ability to code? I believe so, as healthcare is advancing towards a model of prediction and automation. Regardless whether my predictions are true, I’m realizing that I’m drawn to understanding public health and health literacy anyway, where the ability to analyze large datasets may be mandatory in the near future. Therefore, my goal for the remainder of this year is to learn “enough” to contribute to a public health project. The purposes of this repository are to log my progress for future self-review, improve my writing, and organize my stray thoughts so that coherent themes can potentially emerge.

## Previous Attempts and New Approaches
1. **A singular focus versus multiple foci:** I used to want to create individual identities to house the content—however, I have learned that I tend to drift in-and-out of interests, though they tend to be cyclical and revolve around the same 5 topics ([^1]). I’ve also grown appreciation for the tenacity of writers I follow, and the amount of repetition that perhaps is needed to provide “fresh” content all the time in today’s crazy social media world. Therefore, I’ve decided to honor where my mind wants to go, knowing that scattered entries will eventually converge into potential coherent themes.
2. **Fiddling versus Creating:**I hypothesize that in the past, I may have become easily discouraged because it’s hard to learn to code with something useful to show for it in the very beginning, and I saw coding and content creation as two separate activities, with the former being a barrier to the latter. Too many CMSs have been tempered with to date with little to show for. So this time, I decided to stick with Jekyll hosted on Github to learn how to use git. There are also elements of perfectionism stemming from fear ([^2]), but it’s time for me to come to terms with it. 

## Mantras
1. Only move forward. Iterate but do not destroy.
2. Balance content and coding. 

## Process
1. Use Ulysses and Markdown.
2. Self-impose time limit on each entry. If any topic can be better illustrated with multimedia or expanded upon, “upgrade” by creating a project page.
